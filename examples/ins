Please create an app that looks like and performs like the given image. The app is a virtual 
card sandbox that allows the user to load interactable (draggable) playing cards that can be 
moved between different zones. The zones are the field/battlefield, hand, library, graveyard, 
exile, and command zone. There are no explicit rules because this is not a game, but a 
simulation of cards in real life. All zones and cards are interactable and have their 
respective context menus. Please follow flutter clean architecture and conventions based 
on the files in the rules folder. Look at the example_directory_structure.mdc file for a 
basefile for what widgets may be necessary but adjust based on the clean architecture. If 
you need more images, check the @examples/ folder for more of what the app should look like.

Change the X in the corner into an arrow that points in a circle and also make it ask the user 
for confirmation before resetting the board. If the board is reset, place all cards back into 
their original zone shuffled. Make it so that cards look visibly selected and are draggable 
between zones. Refer to @card-context-1.png ,@card-context-2.png, @card-context-3.png , and 
@card-context-4.png   for an example of what it looks like when selecting a card 
(it is highlighted), what a card's context menu should look like (three dots that appear after 
selecting the card, which let the user see the context menu for the card), and how cards in the 
library appear on the screen (the generic card back is shown). The context menu of a card 
depends on which zone it is currently in (have options that move the card to specific zones 
directly without the user dragging). Unless given the url of the image of the back of a card 
when importing it in (include another url field for the back when importing in case the user 
wants cards to have backs), assume that all cards have a generic back, which is just a white 
background with a thick black outline and text in the middle that says "CARD BACK, NO IMAGE". 
Tapping on the back of a card while it is in the library automatically draws the top card from 
the library zone into the hand zone. Make it so that when "Show Other Zones" is tapped, a mini 
popup with zones that the user can drag cards between appears, check @other-zones-context-menu.png 
for reference. Continue with clean architecture..

The error image in red is what appears when I try tapping "Show Other Zones". The Library does 
not show that there is a card in the zone like in @initial-page.png , It should show the generic 
back of a card (a temporary placeholder for now). The error image in grey that is included is 
what appears when I attempt to move the card from my hand to the field, it doesn't work properly

No errors appear when attempting to move cards between zones but it still does not work. 
Pressing "Show Other Zones" twice shows the error message included in the image. Also, the 
placeholder card shown should be below the library text like how @initial-page has it, what 
you have currently is to the side and very small

Next day: 
Add a button labeled "load deck" to the left of the reset button at the top right of the 
app. Make it open to a menu where the user can load previously saved decks, or open a 
window to let the user load a deck from a folder of their choice. The folder contains 
all cards as image files, import those images as cards into the app and make sure the 
deck appears in the previously saved decks menu. Ensure that if the reset button is 
pressed, the user does not need to re-import the deck and the current deck is reset 
properly. Currently, the library zone is underneath the hand zone, I want it to be lined 
up to the hand zone but on the right side of the screen (check the included image for to 
see what I mean). Reduce the horizontal size of the hand zone if you must, to keep them 
on the same level. Additionally, the library should only show a card visually if there 
are cards in the library. Make a dotted outline around all zones that is slightly larger 
than the zone it encapsulates, that way users can tell if a zone is empty. Make sure to 
correct the library such that if it is empty, no cards/placeholder image is shown. Be 
sure to follow flutter clean architecture while implementing all of this (check the 
rules folder provided for reference).

When using the context menu of a card in my hand to move it to the battlefield an error 
occurs which freezes the application, refer to the image I linked for the error. When 
drawing cards from the library into my hand, if the number of cards lined horizontally 
exceeds the visible size of the hand zone I can no longer see it. Make it so that 
instead, cards stack slightly on top of each other when adding more and more cards, 
effectively making it look like fanned out cards. Only fan when cards can no longer be 
lined up horizontally with full visiblilty. Additionally, since cards will be harder to 
read when they are fanned, have a large popup of the selected card appear above the 
battlefield, a preview of the card. Have the preview close if the user taps anywhere 
but the preview. Allow the user to pinch zoom the preview, but the zoom is limited to 
the zone, don't increase the card size on the screen.

The preview works but I can't get it to close when tapping elsewhere. Fanning the cards 
almost works, however there doesn't seem to be a hard limit on the width hand zone, thus 
cards still end up not visible (going beyond the visible screen), though maybe that is an 
issue with the testing environment. Is there a way you can set the maximum width of the 
hand zone to be proportionate to the width of the window/application/device? It looks 
like its about 3/4th the width of the window (the last 1/4 looks like it would be the 
library zone). Also, can you make it so I can just drag the card into the battlefield. 
Make it so the user doesn't need to long press to select cards, just tapping does the 
preview. Then make it so cards can be dragged between zones (also without long pressing) 
and if the user's finger hovers above a zone before letting go of the drag, move the card 
to the proper place within the zone.

The cards fan when adding, but still go past the hand zone/dotted boundary. Currently, 
they only rotate. They should also be overlapping more with every new card (I included 
in image that showed the cards tilting, but not overlapping). I provided another image 
of an error that occurs when I attempt to drag a card. Tapping outside of the preview 
still does not close it (if it helps, outside the preview should mean anything but the 
preview)

The cards do fan and overlap now, but it should be based on the amount of space all 
the cards use in the zone. I provided a screenshot of the whole window. Currently 
adding more than 4 cards makes them overlap but there is a lot of empty space to the 
right of the cards. The hand should take up the whole zone, overlapping when needed 
to make it look better/more even. Additionally the app freezes up still when I attempt 
to drag the card from my hand to the battlefield
